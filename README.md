### Bridging the gap between physical and digital libraries

SIFT is a web application for the Leap Motion that provides a new way of interacting with digital books. In SIFT, the user can use gestures that are commonly used for print books to consume digital books in a 3D library scene. With the leap motion controller, users can select, organize, open, close, and flip through pages of 3D books.

Currently, the web application is not available on the web. In order to use the application at the moment, please download all the files from this repository and open index.html locally.

#### Gestures and Actions
- Index Finger: A cursor/pointer to point to a specific book (on or off the shelf)
- Pinch with index finger and thumb: Opens the selected book
- Swipe with one hand (when a book is open): (right to left swipe) opens next pages, (left to right swipe) opens previous pages
- Place two hands together (when a book is open): A book closes
- Swipe with one hand (when there is no book open): Books from the shelf fall to the floor
- Two hands: Pan/translate/move the books on the floor and also be able to add it back to the shelf
- Fist (one hand): rotate the camera angle of the application
